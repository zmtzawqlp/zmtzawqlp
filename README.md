### Hi there 👋, I'm a Flutter developer in China.

* 🔭 I created multiple Flutter packages such as [extended_image](https://pub.dev/packages/extended_image), [extended_text](https://pub.dev/packages/extended_text), [extended_text_field](https://pub.dev/packages/extended_text_field) and even more. You can get them from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/fluttercandies.com/packages).

* 🌱 I'm glad to invite you to join our organization [FlutterCandies ](https://github.com/fluttercandies), we can do more for the Flutter community together.

* ✍🏻 Writing blogs at [juejin.im](https://juejin.im/user/5bdc1a32518825170b101080).

* 📫 How to reach me: zmtzawqlp@live.com.

* ☕️ Buy me a coffee if helps.
